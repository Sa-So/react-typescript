# So I learned that :
## toggle-issues
- [issue like this - checkbox not working on first click](https://teamtreehouse.com/community/first-click-checkbox-is-broken-then-after-it-works-in-reverse)
- [this](https://gitbrent.github.io/bootstrap-switch-button-react/) website tells you about the checked property
- but
- if you want it to be checked only for first render u should use the defaultChecked property !
- if you want to use checked , you will have to use onChange

## we can use (!) at the end of a variable to assert it is not null ??!
## we can set string to a number ?!
- typescript showed a squigly line in editor but it ran successfully !
- we converted height in cm to feet & inches [:)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16541392/convert-centimeters-to-inches-using-javascript) 

## testing ?!
- Resource scheduling by swatantra

## i am shocked by these errors.
- I tried to swap an array's elements & it broke the whole app , why ?
- using useState below some other hook can cause issues ? why ?
