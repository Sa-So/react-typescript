# so yesterday 
- I commited the changes on my local branch
- changed branch using git checkout -b "origin/dev" for eg.
- My automatically came to that branch !!!
- how is that even possible ?!
- then I pushed my code to origin (remote branch and it got reflected there !!!)
- Insane !

# git --no-verify ?!
- code was not getting pushed ,
- and it pushed !

# You have to change your author & commited by too
- only for azure devops I guess [hehe](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47807200/git-config-did-not-change-username)
- so the name shown is actually of the person who wrote the code & not the one who just pushed [it](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/faq/change-author-name-email)
