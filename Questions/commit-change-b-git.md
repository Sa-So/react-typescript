# so yesterday 
- I commited the changes on my local branch
- changed branch using git checkout -b "origin/dev" for eg.
- My automatically came to that branch !!!
- how is that even possible ?!
- then I pushed my code to origin (remote branch and it got reflected there !!!)
- Insane !


# git undo last commit without losing code
- git reset --soft HEAD^

# git --no-verify ?!
