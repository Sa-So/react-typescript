## 18 Component Props
- Key Takeaways
  - use {component:Component} to make prop as lowercase only , & then rename it to Capitalized 
  - bcoz Components have their first letter capital by convention.
  - type of component : React.ComponentType
  - if that component also recieves props ! then use <>
  - type props = {component : React.ComponentType<thatCompProps> }
  - don't forget to export their type in the current doc from where the comp is declared !
