# my system is full in storage & ram
- a lot of my storage is taken up by system files ! (around 70 GB !!)
- what is in those files ?? ! I can't even delete !
- If I use a cleaner I will prob lose important information !!


# are ram and storage related ?
- not sure about windows but for mac they are !
- you know it when you run out of application memory & there are very less to no apps open !
