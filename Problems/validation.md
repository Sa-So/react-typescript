# what is the best way to validate input in forms ?
- regex ?
- if else ?
- input type ?
- input type + attrib (like minlen) ?
- input type + attrib + pattern ?
- we use all !

# if inline css is bad why not seperate the validation part too in an external file ?
- why are we using inline validation ? 
- semantic html is neccessary for not even allowing the user to email incorrectly.(we can also control it but KeydownEvents)
- regex is advanced way to test ,  less code =  better  .(but who understands it ?)
- if else is used to check if you have violated a particular aspect of it & show it to you so you can correct it ! (like length of password / use capital letters )

# why are we still here ? just to suffer
